# After-College

- This page is used to entail what my plans after college are. As of right now, my plan is to become a **2LT** in the US Army through the ROTC program here at Mizzou. While I don't get to choose whether or not I want to go **_Active duty or National Guard_**, I hope to get Active Duty. Nor do I get to choose what job I get, I am hoping to get a job in the **IT** related field. 

- As of right now, I do not know how many years I will spend in the Army, but during my time, I hope to eventually get a _Master's Degree_ and be able to use it for whenever my Army career is over.
